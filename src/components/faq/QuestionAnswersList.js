        question: "When should I enter my daily productivity data?",
        answer: "When you find yourself coming close to the end of work day or later part of the day in general. Ideally, it's around the evening time of the day since most of us finish our work hours then. If you're someone who works at night, you might want to enter the data at night."
    },
    {
        question: "When do my saved answers reset?",
        answer: "The productivity data resets every night at 12:00 AM local time. If you continue your tasks/work beyond this time, your data should still be recorded for how you did the entire day before 12:00 AM. The work done after that should be considered as next day's work and the data can be entered the following day."
    },
    {
        question: "Are my answers publicly shared/visible?",
        answer: "The answers are not publicly shared nor are they visible to any other users. They are only meant to be shown on the device and the Chrome user account where you have installed the extension. It is also in our interest to increase the data security in the days to come."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I save my answers multiple times in a single day?",
        answer: "Yes, you can. While this is possible, it would not be recommended to change your answers and save them multiple times in a day. Ideally, you should enter your answers end of your work day and not have to go back to it unless you feel it's necessary. Reason being, towards the end of your work day, you can reflect upon the work you have done for the day and answer the questions all at once."
    },
    {
        question: "Why am I unable to save my answers right after I save once?",
        answer: "To avoid changing answers over and over again in a short span of time, the save button gets disabled right after you save for some time. The current duration for this disabling is set to 10 minutes. However, this duration may vary depending on the usage."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the meaning or importance of each of the questions?",
        answer: "Each question (or metric) is trying to measure some specific dimension that leads to you being productive (or not). The metrics can be used in conjunction with one another to give you an idea about your productivity. The charts and graphs on your dashboard are the result of measuring these different metrics. To understand each question in detail, please head over to the <a href='/#/metrics'>Metrics</a> page."
