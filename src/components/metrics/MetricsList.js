        question: "How'd you do today?",
        answer: "Simple, yet an important question to record how you feel. While we keep track of all the numbers and figures, we must also remember this qualitative piece of information, i.e, our emotion/mood. This metric helps us track the Satisfaction and Well-being dimension to understand how we feel across the day/week/month."
    },
    {
        question: "What time of the day were you most productive?",
        answer: "The goal of this metric is to find out at what time of the day we find ourselves being the most productive. This will help you understand when to have your focus time in a day. This is when you're in the flow state and highly productive."
    },
    {
        question: "Were you distracted?",
        answer: "Did you find yourself falling into different sources of distractions? Or were you away from it all? This metric simply tracks how often you are distracted. This could be through social media, constant notifications, personal matter, or anything that keeps you from completing your task."
    },
    {
        question: "Did you work with other people?",
        answer: "How often did you connect with other colleagues? This could be for some help you're asking for, a formal chat, a meeting to discuss something, or anything that includes work and humans! This helps us identify and track the Communication/Collaboration dimension better."
    },
    {
        question: "Were you interrupted during work?",
        answer: "Interruptions can be in many forms. It could be as simple as a call while you're hard at work, someone breaking your flow state or ironically, even work meetings."
    },
    {
        question: "Did you do a lot of work?",
        answer: "This metric tracks the Activity dimension wherein it simply tracks the amount of work you have done in a day. It doesn't talk about the quality here, it's simply the quantity, the amount of efforts you have put."
    },
    {
        question: "Did you do high quality work?",
        answer: "While the above metric tracks the Activity side of things, this metric tries to track the Performance dimension. It tracks the quality of our work. It helps us understand if our work is adding value or is of high quality. Doing a lot of work might not necessarily mean doing high quality work."
    },
    {
        question: "Did you take enough breaks?",
        answer: "Amidst all of the work, socializing, etc, we must also take time to slow down and take a second to breathe. This metric aims to record and track the frequency of the breaks we take in middle of our work. Too much or too less can both be equally unproductive."
    },
    {
        question: "How was your sleep last night?",
        answer: "Sleep can be a huge factor in our day to day productivity. Lack of sleep can leave us feeling less motivated, less productive and in general not at our best state. That being said, everyone's sleep schedules and cycles differ and each one has his/her own way of handling it. This metric helps us find correlations between our sleep quality and our productivity."
